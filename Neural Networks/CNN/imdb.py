'''
Initialize the dataset -->
- Dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from 
IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative)
- It has already been preprocessed 
such that the reviews (sequences 
of words) have been converted to 
sequences of integers, where each 
integer represents a specific word 
in a dictionary.
- For convenience, words are indexed by 
overall frequency in the dataset, so that 
for instance the integer "3" encodes the 
3rd most frequent word in the data.
- This allows for quick filtering operations such 
as: "only consider the top 10,000 most common words, 
but eliminate the top 20 most common words".

x_train, x_test: list of sequences, which are 
lists of indexes (integers). If the num_words 
argument was specific, the maximum possible index 
value is num_words-1. If the maxlen argument was 
specified, the largest possible sequence length is maxlen

y_train, y_test: list of integer labels (1 or 0)
