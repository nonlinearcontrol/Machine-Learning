Dataset of 60,000 28x28 pixel grayscale images of 
the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images.

shape (num_samples, 28, 28)

Scale these values to a range of 0 to 1 before feeding

The basic building block of a neural network is the layer. 
Layers extract representations from the data fed into them. 
And, hopefully, these representations are more meaningful 
for the problem at hand

 The model's compile step:
- Loss function —This measures how accurate the model 
is during training. We want to minimize this function 
to "steer" the model in the right direction
- Optimizer —This is how the model is updated based 
on the data it sees and its loss function.
- Metrics —Used to monitor the training and testing steps.
We want the accuracy, the fraction of the images that 
are correctly classified

# Train the model
#################

'''
Training the neural network model requires the following steps:
1. Feed the training data to the model—in this example, 
the train_images and train_labels arrays.
2. The model learns to associate images and labels.
3. We ask the model to make predictions about a test set—in 
this example, the test_images array. We verify that the predictions 
match the labels from the test_labels array
4. To start training, call the model.fit method—the model 
is "fit" to the training data
